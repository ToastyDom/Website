The [Algonauts Project 2025 Challenge](https://algonautsproject.com/) is now live! This year‚Äôs challenge invites researchers to predict human brain responses to complex multimodal movies using state-of-the-art computational models.

### Challenge Overview

The 2025 edition leverages the largest dataset of human brain responses to naturalistic movies in collaboration with the Courtois Project on Neuronal Modelling (CNeuroMod). This challenge promotes innovation in neuroscience and machine learning by focusing on **out-of-distribution generalization**, fostering robust and generalizable brain encoding models. 

Participants will test their models through the Codabench platform, with transparent and comparable results via a public leaderboard. Winners will present their findings at the **Conference on Cognitive Computational Neuroscience (CCN) 2025**, held in Amsterdam.
