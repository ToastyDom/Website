summary: "Demonstration of the Net2Brain toolbox for comparing DNN and brain representational spaces, featuring a hands-on Colab tutorial."
abstract: 'We introduce Net2Brain, a graphical and command-line user interface toolbox for comparing the representational spaces of artificial deep neural networks (DNNs) and human brain recordings. Net2Brain supports activations from over 600 DNNs trained on diverse vision-related tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation, depth estimation, action recognition), for both image and video datasets. It computes representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) from activations and compares them to brain recordings using representational similarity analysis (RSA), weighted RSA, and searchlight search. The toolbox also allows integration of new stimuli and brain recording datasets. An example demonstrates its utility for testing cognitive computational neuroscience hypotheses.'
